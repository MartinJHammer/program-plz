## Thoughts
- Core Exercise > Modifiers 
- Difficulty within Family tree
- Sort
    Muscle group
    Equipment
- Use gifs to show form/technique
- Detail levels
    > Only text (exercise name, modification(s), reps, kg's etc.)
    > W. one gif showing the whole exercise (angles can be changed) + text pointers / cues. This can be set for all exercises at the same time.
    > Full: With proper video, text description, gifs, correct form, incorrect form, etc. Only one exercise at a time
- Add average set time to an exercise
    > Setup time
    > Average time to complete rep
- Quality focus (strength|functionality|endurance)
- Incorporate a bit of humor
- Current program analysis
    + How many kg will they move (at x BW, etc.).
    + How many reps will a muscle group do?
    + What qualities will be trained to what degree?
- Replace ExerciseType vertical, horizontal with orientation/direction
